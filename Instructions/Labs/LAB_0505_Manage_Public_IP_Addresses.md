# Lab - Manage Public IP Addresses in Azure Stack Hub
# Student lab manual

## Lab dependencies

- None

## Estimated Time

30 minutes

## Lab scenario

You are an operator of an Azure Stack Hub environment. You need to manage public IP address resources. 

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Manage public IP address resources

## Lab Environment

This lab uses an ADSK instance integrated with Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) (backed up Active Directory as the identity provider). 

The lab environment consists of the following components:

- ASDK deployment running on the **AzS-HOST1** server with the following access points:

  - Administrator portal: https://adminportal.local.azurestack.external
  - Admin ARM endpoint: https://adminmanagement.local.azurestack.external
  - User portal: https://portal.local.azurestack.external
  - User ARM endpoint: https://management.local.azurestack.external

- Administrative users:

  - ASDK cloud operator username: **CloudAdmin@azurestack.local**
  - ASDK cloud operator password: **Pa55w.rd1234**
  - ASDK host administrator username: **AzureStackAdmin@azurestack.local**
  - ASDK host administrator password: **Pa55w.rd1234**

You will install software necessary to manage Azure Stack Hub via PowerShell in the course of this lab. You will also create additional user accounts.
