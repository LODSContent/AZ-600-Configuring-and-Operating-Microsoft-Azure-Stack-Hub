# Lab - Manage offers and plans in Azure Stack Hub
# Student lab manual

## Lab dependencies

- None

## Estimated Time

60 minutes

## Lab scenario

You are an operator of an Azure Stack Hub environment. You need to implement offers and plans for your users. You need to ensure that all users have the same set of base services but want to provide access to additional services only to some users.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Implement Azure Stack Hub offers and plans by using the Azure Stack Hub administrator portal

## Lab Environment 

The lab environment consists of the following components:

- ASDK deployment running on the **AzS-HOST1** server with the following access points:

  - Administrator portal: https://adminportal.local.azurestack.external
  - Admin ARM endpoint: https://adminmanagement.local.azurestack.external
  - User portal: https://portal.local.azurestack.external
  - User ARM endpoint: https://management.local.azurestack.external

- Administrative users:

  - ASDK cloud operator username: **CloudAdmin@azurestack.local**
  - ASDK cloud operator password: **Pa55w.rd1234**
  - ASDK host administrator username: **AzureStackAdmin@azurestack.local**
  - ASDK host administrator password: **Pa55w.rd1234**

You will create additional user accounts in the course of this lab.
